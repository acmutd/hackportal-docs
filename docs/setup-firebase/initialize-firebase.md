# Initialize Firebase

To create a Firebase project, you will need a Google account. If you do not have one, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

Now that you have a Google account, you can create a Firebase project.

**ONLY** If you already have a Firebase project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click on the project you want to use.
3. Click on the gear icon next to **Project Overview**.
4. Click **Project settings**.
5. Scroll down to **Your apps**.
6. Click on the web app you want to use.
7. Make sure **npm** is selected for your **SDK setup and configuration**.
8. You can now skip to [Firebase Config](/docs/setup-firebase/firebase-config).
