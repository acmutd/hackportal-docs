# Basic Troubleshooting

Sometimes software doesn't work as expected. Here are some basic troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve issues.

1. **Check the console**: Open up the developer tools in your browser and check for any error messages in the console. This can often give you clues about what's going wrong.

2. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure that all the dependencies are up to date and properly installed.

3. **Check code**: Double-check the code to make sure there are no syntax errors or typos.

4. **Check the network**: Ensure that network requests are being sent and received properly.

5. **Test in different browsers**: Test the website in different browsers to see if the issue is browser-specific.

6. **Restart the development server**: Sometimes, simply restarting the development server can resolve issues.

7. **Use debug tools**: Use debugging tools like React Developer Tools and Redux DevTools to trace the issue.

8. **Check the server**: If the issue is related to the server, check the server logs to see if there are any errors or issues on the server side.

9. **Ask for help on Discord**: If you're still stuck, ask for help on the [HackPortal Discord](https://discord.gg/2gkhwX5fdV) in the help forum.
