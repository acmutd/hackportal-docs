# Admin Setup

1. To set up your superadmin account, **start the development server and use the sign-in button to create an account.** 
2. Once the account has been created, **navigate to the Firestore Database in Firebase and go to the "/registrations" collection.** 
3. Find the document with your **sign-in and under the "permissions" array in the "user" map, update the "hacker" role to "super_admin".** 

You should now have **FULL ACCESS** to the Admin panel.
