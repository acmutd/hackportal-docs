# Instructions

The hackerpack is where we place all the resources that could aid a hacker during and before the hackathon. Some commonly placed categories on this page include:

- General Information
- Food (both provided and nearby restaurants)
- Workshop Info
- FAQ
- ...and anything else that could help!
